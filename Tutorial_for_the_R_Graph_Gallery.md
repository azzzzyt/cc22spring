# Tutorial for the r graph gallery

Yayun Luo and Yu Cheng

## Motivation

In the process of drawing graphs, we often don't know what code to enter in R or python to come up with the graph we need. Then, we learned about the website R graph gallery, which we found very helpful for drawing graphs in R or python. In this site we will not only learn about various data graphs, but also know the exact code to draw these graphs. We can modify and create our own code according to our needs to get the best image for the real situation. This website greatly enhances the accuracy and presentation of our charts and saves us a lot of time in the process of data analysis. Therefore, we have made this tutorial to help you better use R and python to draw charts.
