# Data visualization course cheatsheet

Xilin Huang and Pengfei Yan


This is a cheatsheet that serves as a brief and handy summary of what students have seen so far in the course. 
While the cheatsheet by no means includes all the important points in lectures, the motivation is to refresh studentsâ€™ memories by providing a holistic view. Students are encouraged to refer back to respective lectures to find more detailed explanations. This cheatsheet aims to assist students to use learned materials in their later projects and practices. 
In the process of making this cheatsheet, we have solidified our understanding of the course materials. However, we struggled to select the most representative pointers in order to keep the cheatsheet in a concise, two-page format.

The cheatsheet can be accessed through the link:
