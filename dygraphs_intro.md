# `dygraphs` package

## what I did

My purpose of the dygraphs is to provide not only a comprehensive introduction of each function but also interactive display of each function under `xaringan` package.

- I summarized relative function in dygraphs and its instructions in the same data.
- I created a interactive html using `xaringan` package for introducing each function and its display effect.
