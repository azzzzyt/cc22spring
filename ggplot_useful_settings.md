# Useful setting of ggplot2

Yixuan Zhang

## Motivation

ggplot2 is the most common package that I used for plotting. Besides the ability to draw different kinds of plots, it also contains a lot of useful settings to make the plot more beautiful and informative. For example, transposing x and y axis, changing the location of the legend, changing the angle of the text of axis, etc. Therefore, I made this cheat sheet help people check those useful settings. Intentionally, I made it on Rshiny. Therefore, people can interact with the setting and there is a text box designed to show the code where people can do copy&paste to use the code.
